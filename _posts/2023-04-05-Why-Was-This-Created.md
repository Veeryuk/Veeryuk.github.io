Hi, I am Nova Rudy. I go by they/them pronouns and I am a FIRST Alumni, Mentor and, Volunteer. Now you may be asking yourself, why does this website exist? Well it's to highlight why FIRST needs to move the FIRST World Championship out of Houston for the safety of transgender and gender non-conforming people of FIRST along with highlighting stories of LGBTQ+ individuals and their comments about FIRST having the FIRST World Championship inside the state of Texas.
