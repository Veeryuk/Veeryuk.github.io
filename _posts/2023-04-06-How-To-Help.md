This blog post contains some ways that you can help the LGBTQ+ of FIRST community feel safe and welcome at the FIRST World Championship. A lot of these are suggestions for teams as a whole however, all of these can also be done by individuals:

### Have your team hang up transgender and LGBTQ+ pride flags inside of their pit.
This is an easy and low cost idea that allows people to show their support for LGBTQ+ and transgender people. Show FIRST that we are here, we are queer and we are going to be vocal about it. Even if you don't have out LGBTQ+ people on your team, still hang those flags high to show that your team is an ally to the LGBTQ+ community.
### Keep a resource list for transgender and gender non-conforming students (I have one from the LGBTQ+ of FIRST that is linked below) on hand.
Having this would allow for anyone who is questioning their identity to get resources on all of it on top of resources for transgender and GnC individuals who may need support because their parents aren’t supportive. Here is a link to the google sheet that has everything from crisis hotlines to questioning your identity: [[Link]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQ6fYw1kBqHpMyeCnl3Vv1cVyXlXWwcdtCeuPKuug2g/edit?usp=sharing)
### Promote wearing pronoun badges as a normality.
Show that pronouns are something we should care about because it can affect a person's mental health if they are called by the correct pronouns. Have people on your teams wear them, they should be given out by pit admin at champs. ==(This does not mean to out people. If people don’t want to be outed, don’t force them)==
### Hang signs up within your teams pit saying that discrimination of any kind is prohibited and/or that their pit is a safe space for all LGBTQ+ people.
Show that your team is committed to making sure that FIRST is a safe and welcoming environment for all, even in hostile states like Texas. Having these signs up says thatyour team is inclusive of LGBTQ+ identities and that your team will continue to make sure that any LGBTQ+ person is able to be themselves on the team or even if they are talking to your team.
### Continue putting pressure on FIRST via letter drafting and email writing.
Show FIRST that this isn’t a small minority of people that are going to lay down and give up, that we will continue to fight until transgender and GnC students are safe at the FIRST World Championship.
### Spread the Google Form
The more information and survey answers I get, the better I can understand how we can support out LGBTQ+ students, mentors, alumni, and volunteers.
