### Introduction

Hi I am Nova R.

I am a non-binary gay individual living inside of Texas temporarily with my partner. I am a Electrical Engineering Technology Major and I love spending as much time as I can with FRC. I spend most of my days at my internship in Texas with my weekends either doing robotics competitions or just relaxing with my partner.
